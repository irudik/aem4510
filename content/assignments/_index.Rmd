## Final project 

### Essay
For your final project you will write a 5 page essay on an environmental policy or an environmental financial instrument. Up to three teams of students can work on the same topic. Detailed instructions will be circulated later in class. The high-level idea is that you will:

- Describe the background of the policy/instrument, its objective, and how it achieves it.
- Analyze its effectiveness in the real world.
- Propose how to improve it and convincingly describe why your proposal is an improvement.

### Presentation
During the last days of class, teams will present their work. For each topic, 1 team will be responsible for each of the following:

- Presenting the background and objectives of the policy/instrument.
- Presenting a case for why the policy/instrument is successful and an important tool.
- Presenting a case for why the policy/instrument falls short of proponent's stated goals.

Presentations will be short: 5-10 minutes and about 5 slides.
