## Problem sets

You will have 5 problem sets. You may consult with me or the TAs during office hours. <span style="color:red">**Students taking the class at the 5000 level will have extra problems in each problem set.**</span> 

**When are they due?** 

- Tentative problem set due dates: XYZ
- Problem sets are due on 11:59PM on the listed due date.
- <span style="color:blue">No</span> late problem sets will be accepted.

**Who can I work with, how do I submit them?** 

- You may work in groups of up to 3 on problem sets. 
- On Canvas, submit one problem set per group with all group members names on it.
- If you are doing the problem set on pen and paper you **must** scan and convert it into a pdf using something like [Adobe Scan](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html). Pictures will not be accepted.

## Prelims 

**When are the prelims?**

- Tentative prelim dates: March 21, May 9 (all day)
- The prelims are in class during our regular class time

**What do the prelims cover?**

- The first will largely cover sections [01](/lecture-notes/01-introduction) to [09](/lecture-notes/09-discounting/), the second will cover the rest of the course. 
- The prelims will have questions based on the slides and readings assigned.
