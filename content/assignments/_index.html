<li>Analyze its effectiveness in the real world.</li>
<li>Propose how to improve it and convincingly describe why your proposal is an improvement.</li>

<p>During the last days of class, teams will present their work. For each topic, 1 team will be responsible for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presenting the background and objectives of the policy/instrument.</li>
<li>Presenting a case for why the policy/instrument is successful and an important tool.</li>
<li>Presenting a case for why the policy/instrument falls short of proponent’s stated goals.</li>
