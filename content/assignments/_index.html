<div id="problem-sets" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem sets</h3>
<p>You will have 4 problem sets. 2 will focus on the theory of the environment and regulation. 2 will focus on empirical analysis of environmental issues. You may work in groups of up to 3 on problem sets. Problem sets may be turned in late with a penalty of 20% of that homeworkâ€™s grade for each day it is late. Problem sets are due at the start of class on Canvas. Turn in one problem set per group with all group members names on it. You may consult with me, Lin, or Diego during office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Theory problem sets due dates:</strong> March 7, March 28</p>
<p><strong>Empirical Problem sets due dates:</strong> April 18, May 6</p>

<div id="group-project-paper" class="section level3">
<h3>Group project paper</h3>
<p>You are expected to work on the group project in a group of 4-6 students. You must submit your group roster as an assignment on Canvas by March 25th. If you do not have a particular group that you wish to work with, email <strong>Lin Yang</strong> at least 1 week before the deadline and she will assign you to a project group.</p>
<p>For the group project, a list of topics and potential data sources are posted on Canvas under the Group Project module. Alternatively, I encourage you to come up with your own topic and collect your own data. One way to do that is to read recent literature from major environmental economic or general economic journal (e.g., Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics) that discusses a very specific environmental issue with economic consequences.</p>
<p>The final products will be a paper between 8-15 pages not including references but everything else (12 point font, double spaced, 1 in margins).</p>
<p>The group paper should have the following five sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> a maximum of 1 page summary of your paper (be sure to include names of all authors)</li>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Please include the following subsections: (1) What is the issue (define the problem), and (2) why is this issue important? One way to establish your argument in the second subsection is to include quotes from major newspapers or magazines, such as the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the Economists, or some quote by some major public figure (politician etc.) that discusses the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Economic analysis and findings:</strong> For an empirical project, this section should include data and empirical model. For a theoretical paper, it should include a theoretical model or theoretical arguments and derivations. Findings should be presented here.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Discuss briefly what lessons we can learn from the study (e.g., policy suggestions).</li>
<li><strong>References:</strong> List all the references used in your article. These are easy to obtain from Google Scholar.</li>
</ol>
<p>The paper has to be submitted on Canvas (1 submission per group) no later than 11:59PM on May 25th. In addition to the paper, each team member will anonymously assess the contribution and effort of the other team members. This assessment will factor into your grade.</p>
<p><strong>Team roster due date:</strong> March 25</p>
<p><strong>Paper due date:</strong> May 25</p>
<p><strong>Teammate assessment due date:</strong> May 25</p>
</div>
<div id="group-project-presentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Group project presentation</h3>
<p>Along with the final paper your group will need to give a class presentation with 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&amp;A (the presentation time divided equally among the members). The group presentations will be held during the last 2-3 lectures depending on the number of groups. The grade for the group project will be based on both the presentation and the paper itself.</p>
<p><strong>Due date:</strong> Last two days of class</p>
