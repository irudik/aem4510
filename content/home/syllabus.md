**Course description:** This class will focus on the role of the environment in the theory and practice of economics. It will make use of microeconomic analysis at the intermediate level and will incorporate real-world examples. It examines market failures, externalities, benefit-cost analysis, non-market valuation techniques, cost-effective policy instruments, and recent applied work on the economics of the environment. 

**Course requirements:** Students are expected to prepare for class and complete all assignments.

## Other things

**Attendance:** Class attendance is not explicitly required but highly recommended.

**Grade appeals:** If you wish to appeal your grade on an assignment you must bring it to my attention, in writing, within 24 hours of when the assignment is returned.  *Grades brought to my attention after this will not be eligible for a grade appeal.* I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and the new grade will be final.

**Integrity of credit:** I expect every student in this course to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. I strongly encourage collaboration in this course, but each student is responsible for making sure that she or he follows the rules laid out in this syllabus, and with those stated in the Code of Academic Integrity. Any student found to have violated the stated policies on an assignment will receive a zero on that assignment. Violations may result in failure of the course. The Code of Academic Integrity is available for review here: https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm.

<!-- **Coding:** We will be using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) for coding. You should not need to install or download anything for what we do in class or for problem sets. If you prefer to do the work on your actual computer install R and RStudio.  -->

**Learning Outcomes:** As a result of participating in class you will be able to:
  - Discuss the design and effect of environmental policy in theory and real-world practice
      - AEM 5510: Also discuss the consequences of environmental policy in second-best environments
  - Use survey and revealed preference methods to value the environment
  - Understand how economists measure the impacts of climate change
      - AEM 5510: Also use real world data to measure economic impacts of climate change
  - Explain how economists measure the economic costs of environmental change such as how air pollution increases mortality 
      - AEM 5510: Also use real world data to estimate the costs of environmental change
