# AEM 4510 - Environmental and Resource Economics

**Class location:** XXXXXXXXX

**Class time:** Monday and Wednesday 1:00-2:15

**Office hours:** Tuesday 1:00-1:30, Thursday 1:30-2:00 on Zoom

**Teaching assistants:** Diego Cardoso (ds2347) and Lin Yang (ly285)

**TA office hours:** Diego: Monday 3:00-4:00 on Zoom, Lin: Wednesday 3:00-4:00 on Zoom

**Readings:**

- Markets and the Environment by Keohane and Olmstead is required.
- [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) by Cunningham is required, free, and comes with R code examples in the text.
- Other readings will be from papers that are freely available.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 1110, AEM 2600 or ECON 3030. An econometrics course like AEM 4110, ECON 3200, or ECON 3210 is highly, highly recommended.

**Course description:** This class will focus on the role of the environment in the theory and practice of economics. It will make use of microeconomic analysis at the intermediate level and will incorporate real-world examples. It examines market failures, externalities, benefit-cost analysis, non-market valuation techniques, cost-effective policy instruments, and recent applied work on the economics of the environment.

**Course requirements:** Students are expected to prepare for class and complete all assignments.

## Grading and Assignments

### Grading
- Class participation / activities: 10%
- 2 Theoretical problem sets: 15% each
- 2 Empirical problem sets: 15% each
- Group project paper and presentation: 30%

The grading scale is:
- A: 92-100; A-: 90-91
- B+: 88-89; B: 82-87; B-: 80-81
- C+: 78-79; C: 72-77; C-: 70-71
- D+: 68-69; D: 62-67; D-: 60-61
- F: < 60



### Problem sets

You will have 4 problem sets. 2 will focus on the theory of the environment and regulation. 2 will focus on empirical analysis of environmental issues. You may work in groups of up to 3 on problem sets. Problem sets may be turned in late with a penalty of 20% of that homework's grade for each day it is late. Problem sets are due at the start of class on Canvas. Turn in one problem set per group with all group members names on it.

### Group project

You are expected to work on the group project in a group of 4-6 students. You must submit your group roster as an assignment on Canvas by March 25th. If you do not have a particular group that you wish to work with, email **Lin Yang** at least 1 week before the deadline and she will assign you to a project group.

For the group project, a list of topics and potential data sources are posted on Canvas under the Group Project module. Alternatively, I encourage you to come up with your own topic and collect your own data. One way to do that is to read recent literature from major environmental economic or general economic journal (e.g., Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics) that discusses a very specific environmental issue with economic consequences.

The final products will be a class presentation with 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&A (the presentation time divided equally among the members) and a paper between 8-15 pages not including references but everything else (12 point font, double spaced, 1 in margins). The group presentations will be held during the last 2-3 lectures depending on the number of groups. The grade for the group project will be based on both the presentation and the paper itself.

The group paper should have the following five sections:

1. **Summary:** a maximum of 1 page summary of your paper (be sure to include names of all authors)
2. **Introduction:** Please include the following subsections: (1) What is the issue (define the problem), and (2) why is this issue important? One way to establish your argument in the second subsection is to include quotes from major newspapers or magazines, such as the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the Economists, or some quote by some major public figure (politician etc.) that discusses the problem.
3. **Economic analysis and findings:** For an empirical project, this section should include data and empirical model. For a theoretical paper, it should include a theoretical model or theoretical arguments and derivations. Findings should be presented here.
4. **Conclusion:** Discuss briefly what lessons we can learn from the study (e.g., policy suggestions).
5. **References:** List all the references used in your article. These are easy to obtain from Google Scholar.

The paper has to be submitted on Canvas (1 submission per group) no later than 11:59PM on May 25th.

### Readings

Some sections of the course have readings (available on Canvas if not in the book or through the library). The lectures, homeworks and exams will draw from these readings. Lecture notes will be posted online at the end of each section.

## Important dates

- Theory problem sets: March 7, March 28
- Empirical problem sets: April 18, May 6
- Group project paper due: May 25
- Final project presentations: Last 2-3 days of class

## Other things

**Attendance:** Class attendance is not explicitly required but highly recommended.

**Grade appeals:** If you wish to appeal your grade on an assignment you must bring it to my attention, in writing, within 24 hours of when the assignment is returned.  Grades brought to my attention after this will not be eligible for a grade appeal. I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and the new grade will be final.

**Group work:** For problem sets, you may consult with me, Lin, or Diego during office hours, or with other students. Problem sets can done in groups of up to 3. If you work in a group, turn in only one assignment for the group.

**Integrity of credit:** I expect every student in this course to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. I strongly encourage collaboration in this course, but each student is responsible for making sure that she or he follows the rules laid out in this syllabus, and with those stated in the Code of Academic Integrity. Any student found to have violated the stated policies on problem sets will receive a zero for that assignment, and any student found to have cheated on a prelim will receive a zero on that prelim. Multiple violations in a semester may result in failure of the course. The Code of Academic Integrity is available for review here: https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm.
