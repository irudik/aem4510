# What's enviro econ?

First, what is economics?

--

.hi[Economics:] the study of how agents (people, firms, etc) make choices with scarce resources and the social results of these choices

--

Everything is scarce compared to wants and needs

--

We need to choose among alternatives and make trade offs

--

These ideas can be applied to the environment

---

# What is enviro econ?

.hi[Environmental Economics:] the application of economics to the study of the environment as a resource or good

--

Environmental economics helps us understand things like:

--

The value of mitigating pollution

--

How agents will response to climate change policies

--

Whether investment tax credits for wind power are cost-effective

---

# Climate change

Why do economists care about climate change?

--

It affects the economy and how we have to allocate resources! How?

--

- Production
--

- Learning
--

- Leisure
--

- Fishing
--

- etc, etc

Environmental economics is actually pretty new

Spurred by .hi[John Krutilla] in the 1950s

His paper .green[Conservation Reconsidered] is the landmark paper in the field (sort of like Wealth of Nations and economics as a whole)

# Micro recap: terminology

.hi[Market:] 
--
a decentralized collection of all actual and potential buyers and sellers whose interactions determine the allocation and price of a good or service through exchange

--

.hi[Demand curve:] 
--
A schedule or graph showing the quantity of a good that buyers wish to buy at each price; it gives us the marginal willingness to pay or the marginal benefit

--

.hi[Supply curve:] 
--
A schedule or graph showing the quantity of a good that sellers wish to sell at each price; it gives us the marginal willingness to accept or the marginal cost

# Market demand slopes down

Why do demand curves slope down?

--

As the price of a good increases, people switch to other, similar goods

--

This is the .hi-red[substitution effect]: if the price of Coke goes up, people buy more Pepsi
  
--

As the price of a good increases, they can't afford as much of it: purchasing power goes down

--

This is the .hi-blue[income effect]: if the price of pizza goes up, we have a lower real budget

---

# Market supply slopes up

Why do supply curves slope up?

--

If we produce more of a good, we choose the lowest (opportunity) cost production processes first, higher cost production processes later

--

Marginal costs go up as production goes up $\rightarrow$ producers need higher prices in order to produce more goods

]

---

# Efficiency

We have two notions of efficiency: 

1. A .hi[socially optimal quantity] is the quantity of the good the maximizes total surplus
--

2. An allocation is .hi[Pareto efficient] if there's no way to change things to make at least one person strictly better off, without making at least one person strictly worse off

--

If you can make one person better off without making anyone else worse off its called a .hi-blue[Pareto improvement]

---

# Are markets efficient?

Are (competitive) markets efficient?

--

Under some assumptions, yes: the .hi[First Welfare Theorem] tells us that any competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient

--

Under these assumptions competitive markets also maximize social welfare

--

.hi-red[Main takeaway]: markets are often a nice way to allocate scarce resources

---

# Under what assumptions are markets efficient?

What are the underlying assumptions for market efficiency?

1. Perfect competition
2. Perfect information
3. Complete markets (minimal transactions costs)
4. .hi-red[No externalities]

--

.hi-red[Externalities] are when an economic transaction imposes a cost or benefit on a third party

--

They drive a wedge between private and social marginal cost, or private and social marginal benefit

---

# The key departures in environmental economics

In enviro econ, the key departure from the standard perfect market is the introduction of externalities and non-rival and non-excludable goods:

--

.hi-red[Non-rival]: additional people can get the benefits of consuming the same unit of the good at no extra cost to others

--

.hi-blue[Non-excludable]: extra individuals can't be precluded from consuming the good

--

|           	|          **Excludable**         	|            **Non-Excludable**            	|
|-----------	|:---------------------------:	|:------------------------------------:	|
|**Rival**    	|     Private goods (food)    	| Common-pool resources (fish, timber) 	|
| **Non-rival**	| Club goods (parks, netflix) 	| Public goods (air, national defense) 	|

---

# Imperfect information

We will also discuss .hi[imperfect information]: when economic actors are uncertainty about the prices or quality of a good

--

If there's imperfect information then efficiency may not be achieved

--

Why?

--

Without the adequate information, buyers or sellers cannot make the choices in their best interest

---

# Efficiency and equity

The First Welfare Theorem guarantees competitive markets give (Pareto) efficient allocations

--

It does not guarantee that these allocations are desirable, any examples?

--

E.g.

--

- If Elon Musk held **all** the wealth in the world, that would be a Pareto efficient outcome even though it goes against basically all people's notions of equity

--

- Perfect price discrimination is also Pareto efficient: producers capture all the surplus but it is maximized
