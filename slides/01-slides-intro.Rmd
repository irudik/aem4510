# What's enviro econ?

First, what is economics?

--

.hi[Economics:] the study of how agents (people, firms, etc) make choices with scarce resources and the social results of these choices

--

Everything is scarce compared to wants and needs

--

We need to choose among alternatives and make trade offs

--

These ideas can be applied to the environment

---

# What is enviro econ?

.hi[Environmental Economics:] the application of economics to the study of the environment as a resource or good

--

Environmental economics helps us understand things like:

--

- The value of mitigating pollution

--

How agents will response to climate change policies

--

Whether investment tax credits for wind power are cost-effective

---

# What is enviro econ?


.pull-left[
Environmental economics is actually pretty new

It is thought to really be started by .hi[John Krutilla] in the 1950s

His paper .green[Conservation Reconsidered] is the landmark paper transforming the field from focusing on managing resources to conservation of the environment

# What are the goals of this class?

1. Enhance your understanding of	how economists think about solving real environmental problems
--

2. Prepare you for after college:
  - Industry jobs (energy, transportation, finance)
  - Public sector and NGOs (EPA, DOE, RFF, Brookings, Federal Reserve)
  - Graduate programs
  
--

3. Learn both the theory and .hi[applications] of environmental economics

# Micro recap: terminology

.hi[Market:] 
--
a decentralized collection of all actual and potential buyers and sellers whose interactions determine the allocation and price of a good or service through exchange

--

.hi[Demand curve:] 
--
A schedule or graph showing the quantity of a good that buyers wish to buy at each price; it gives us the marginal willingness to pay or the marginal benefit

.hi[Supply curve:] 
--
A schedule or graph showing the quantity of a good that sellers wish to sell at each price; it gives us the marginal willingness to accept or the marginal cost
