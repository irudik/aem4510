&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Motivating discounting

Some places are expecting to have huge gains in GDP from mortality risk

--

Others are expecting to have huge losses

--

This is all happening in 60-80 years

--

How do we compare these costs and benefits to those incurred today?

--

We use a .hi[discount rate:] a value that tells us how much future dollars are worth in today's terms

---

# Return to Manne-Richels

We ignored the idea of discounting in our discussion of the Manne-Richels model

--

Let `\(r\)` be the discount rate, so `\(\beta = {1 \over 1+r}\)` is the discount factor

--

Our new problem with discounting is then:

--

`$$\min_{a_1} E[TC] = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}a_1^2}_{\text{current cost}} + \beta\left[(1-p)\times \underbrace{0}_{\text{good state cost}} + p \times \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(1-a_1)^2}_{\text{bad state cost}}\right]$$`

---

# Return to Manne-Richels

The first-order condition is:
`$$\frac{d E[TC]}{da_1} = a^*_1 - \beta p(1-a^*_1) = 0$$`

--

This gives us that:
`$$a^*_1 = \frac{\beta p}{1+\beta p}$$`

--

How does discounting affect our decisionmaking?


---

# Discounting and decisionmaking

`$$a^*_1 = \frac{\beta p}{1+\beta p}$$`

--

First, notice as `\(r \rightarrow \infty\)` we have `\(\beta = {1 \over 1 + r} \rightarrow 0\)`, we put less and less weight on the future

--

This means we do less abatement today in period 1!

--

That's intuitive, let's see what discount actually looks like graphically

--

What is the value of a future payment of $100?

---

# PV of $100

.pull-left[

![higher discount rates mean lower value](09-slides-discounting_files/figure-html/discounting-1.png)
]

.pull-right[
Higher discount rates place less value on future benefits

Things &gt; 30 years in the future have basically no value with a 10% discount rate

At a 1% discount rate we value things 100 years in the future at almost half their value today
]

---

# Discounting

Why does this matter?

--

Lots of things (like climate change) have costs or benefits that occur .hi[far] in the future

--

e.g. the benefits of taking action against climate change will be mostly borne by future generations, decades from now

--

Depending on our choice of discount rate these costs and benefits can be substantial or trivial

---

# Discounting

1 million in damages in 200 years at a discount rate of r = 2% is worth 19,053 today

--

1 million in damages in 200 years at a discount rate of r = 8% is worth only 21 cents today

--

5 orders of magnitude difference!

--

This makes the choice of the discount rate one of the most important (and contentious) things about climate change policy

---

# Discounting: how do we choose?

How do we choose the discount rate?

--

.hi[Option 1:] take the market rate

--

This is just the real interest paid on certain investments

--

In a perfect market equilibrium, it is the productivity of capital

--

Why might this not be the rate we want to choose as a regulator?


---

# Discounting: how do we choose?

Issues with market rates:

--

Market rates don't reflect externalities

--

Super-responsibility of government: the government represents future generations as well as current generations (only current ones are represented in the market)

--

Dual-role of individuals: in political roles, people are more concerned about future generations than in their day-to-day behavior which determines the market rate

---

# Discounting: how do we choose?

.hi[Option 2:] social discounting

--

With social discounting with determine the discount rate from economic and ethical considerations

--

Why should we discount the future?

--

First, time: people are impatient

--

And growth: if someone is richer in 10 years, a dollar is worth more to them today than in 10 years in utility terms 


---

# Ramsey Discounting

With a decent amount of math we can show that the social discount rate `\(r\)` is composed of three terms:
`$$r = \delta + \eta \times g$$`

--

`\(\delta\)` is called the .hi[pure rate of time preference] or .hi[utility discount rate]: how much do we value future *utility*

--

`\(\eta\)` is the .hi[elasticity of marginal utility]: how quickly does marginal utility decline in consumption?

--

`\(g\)` is the .hi[growth rate]: how fast does consumption grow over time?

---

# Ramsey Discounting

Here's some alternative descriptions of how to think about these terms:

--

`\(\delta\)`: how much is 1 util tomorrow worth today?

--

`\(\eta\)`: how much do we value poorer vs richer times/generations? Bigger `\(\eta\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` more averse to inequality over time
- `\(\eta = - {U''(X)X \over U'(X)}\)`, how many percent does MU change if consumption changes by 1%

--

`\(g\)`: how rich will we / future generations be compared to today?

---

# Ramsey Discounting

`$$r = \delta + \eta \times g$$`

What this means is that if we have values for `\(r\)`, `\(\eta\)`, and `\(g\)`, we can compute the "correct" discount rate

--

How do we get values for these terms?

--

Two common approaches: descriptive and prescriptive


---

# Ramsey Discounting: the descriptive approach

The descriptive approach aims to calibrate the discount rate to the real world

--

We can observe `\(g\)` in the data / forecasts

--

We can sometimes estimate `\(\eta\)` from observed behavior over time

--

Once we pick a `\(\delta\)` we have our discount rate `\(r\)`

--

The descriptive approach generally chooses `\(\delta\)` so `\(r\)` matches market rates

---

# Ramsey Discounting: the prescriptive approach

First we decide on the 'correct' level of `\(\delta\)` and `\(\eta\)`

--

Then we observe `\(g\)` in the data / forecasts

--

That gives us `\(r\)`

---

# What's the utility discount rate?

Both approaches depend on us choosing `\(\delta\)`

--

What is the right value for `\(\delta\)`?

--

Ramsey (1928): placing different weights upon the utility of different generations is â€˜ethically indefensible'

--

Harrod (1948): discounting utility represented a 'polite expression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by passion'

--

The above arguments are ethical arguments, so are typically used by those favoring the prescriptive approach


---

# What's the discount rate? Descriptive

The descriptive approach often results in `\(\delta\)` being between 2-3% from reverse engineering the observed market rates

--

`\(\eta\)` is then often engineered to be between 1 and 4

--

`\(g\)` is observed and generally between 1 and 3%

--

Thus the discount rate usually lies between 2 and 7%

--

Quick example: `\(\delta = 2\%, \eta = 2, g = 2\% \rightarrow r = 6\%\)`

---

# What's the discount rate? Prescriptive

The prescriptive approach often results in `\(\delta\)` being zero or nearly zero for the ethical reasons described above

---

# What's the discount rate? Prescriptive

Choosing `\(\eta\)` also conveys ethical choices: how do we weigh the distribution of consumption across generations

--

Recall: `\(r = \delta + \eta g\)`

--

- `\(\eta = 0\)`: consumption in the future doesn't change our willingness to save/invest today (r is independent of g)

--

- `\(\eta\)` is large: if there is positive growth, we are .hi[less] likely to invest in the future (future generations will be rich anyway)

--

- `\(\eta\)` is large: if there is negative growth, we are .hi[more] likely to invest in the future (future generations will be poorer than today)

---

# Distributive justice

Rawl's theory of justice applied here would set `\(\delta = 0\)` and `\(\eta = \infty\)`: fairness for all

--

More egalitarian perspectives with respect to:

.hi[time] 
--
yields a smaller `\(\delta\)` and `\(r\)`

--

.hi[intergenerational inequality] 
--
yields a larger `\(\eta\)` and larger `\(r\)` if growth is positive
