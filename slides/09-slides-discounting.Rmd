# Roadmap

1. What is discounting?
2. What determines the discount rate?
3. What are the implications of discounting on computing the costs and benefits of policies?

# Motivating discounting

Some places are expecting to have huge gains in GDP from mortality risk

--

Others are expecting to have huge losses

--

This is all happening in 60-80 years

--

How do we compare these costs and benefits to those incurred today?

--

We use a .hi[discount rate:] a value that tells us how much future dollars are worth in today's terms

---

# Return to Manne-Richels

We ignored the idea of discounting in our discussion of the Manne-Richels model

--

Let $r$ be the discount rate, so $\beta = {1 \over 1+r}$ is the discount factor

--

Our new problem with discounting is then:

--

$$\min_{a_1} E[TC] = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}a_1^2}_{\text{current cost}} + \beta\left[(1-p)\times \underbrace{0}_{\text{good state cost}} + p \times \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(1-a_1)^2}_{\text{bad state cost}}\right]$$

---

# Return to Manne-Richels

The first-order condition is:
$$\frac{d E[TC]}{da_1} = a^*_1 - \beta p(1-a^*_1) = 0$$

--

This gives us that:
$$a^*_1 = \frac{\beta p}{1-\beta p}$$

--

How does discounting affect our decisionmaking?


---

# Discounting and decisionmaking

$$a^*_1 = \frac{\beta p}{1-\beta p}$$

--

First, notice as $r \rightarrow \infty$ we have $\beta = {1 \over 1 + r} \rightarrow 0$, we put less and less weight on the future

--

This means we do less abatement today in period 1!

--

That's intuitive, let's see what discount actually looks like graphically

--

What is the value of a future payment of $100?

---

.pull-right[
Higher discount rates place less value on future benefits

Things > 30 years in the future have basically no value with a 10% discount rate

At a 1% discount rate we value things 100 years in the future at almost half their value today

# Discounting

Why does this matter?

--

Lots of things (like climate change) have costs or benefits that occur .hi[far] in the future

--

e.g. the benefits of taking action against climate change will be mostly borne by future generations, decades from now

--

Depending on our choice of discount rate these costs and benefits can be substantial or trivial

---

# Discounting

1 million in damages in 200 years at a discount rate of r = 2% is worth 19,053 today

--

1 million in damages in 200 years at a discount rate of r = 8% is worth only 21 cents today

--

5 orders of magnitude difference!

--

This makes the choice of the discount rate one of the most important (and contentious) things about climate change policy
