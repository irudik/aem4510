# Roadmap

1. What are offsets?
2. What issues might they have?
3. How do they work in practice?

# What are offsets?

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

---

# What are offsets?

Governments and organizations have adopted ambitious carbon reduction goals
  - EU: net-zero by 2050
  - Microsoft: carbon-*negative* by 2030
  - Harvard: carbon-neutral by 2026
  
--

How can these goals be achieved?

--

These orgs can reduce their own emissions, 
--
or .hi[pay others] to reduce emissions to offset their own

--

These are called .hi[carbon offsets]


---

# What are offsets?

If you buy as many offsets as your total emissions, technically you are net-zero

--

Offsets are potentially a great idea, why?

--

Emissions reductions in the EU might be really expensive: we already did all the cheap carbon abatement
   
--

Other places haven't done much at all so there are still lots of low-cost opportunities

--

This can reduce costs since it doesn't really matter *where* we reduce carbon emissions


---

# Offset markets around the world


<div style= "float:right;position: relative;">
```{r, out.width = "575px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("files/15-offset-market-size.png")
```
</div> 

Offset markets are currently small but are expected to grow as countries march up their MAC curves

--

There are (at least) two big sets of carbon offsets:
- Forest carbon offsets
- Clean development mechanism


---

# Forest carbon offsets

How do forest carbon offsets work?

--

There's a person or group or owns some land (e.g. farmer, indigenous tribe, government, etc)

--

The group is paid by another organization to:
1. Preserve the forest they otherwise were going to cut down in the near future
2. Plant a forest on barren land

--

The avoided emissions from burned trees (1) or absorbed carbon (2) are the .hi[carbon offsets]

---

# Forest carbon offsets

.center[
```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.pos="l", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("files/15-how-many-trees.png")
```
]

How much carbon can a tree absorb?

---

# Forest carbon offsets

*[...] studies have estimated an average Americanâ€™s carbon footprint at around 16 tons of CO2 annually, one of the highest figures for any country because of the energy-intensive American lifestyle. A single mature tree, meanwhile, may take in about 50 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. At this rate, it would take 640 trees per person to account for all American emissions, which adds up to more than 200 billion trees.*

50 pounds per trees $\times$ 3 trillion trees $=$ 70 billion tons of carbon stored in trees

This is about 2 years worth of emissions

# Potential issues with offsets

---

# Challenges with offsets

What do you see as potential issues with carbon offsets?

--

.hi[Additionality:] the landowner would have preserved or planted the forest even in the absence of offset payments

--

.hi[Leakage:] preserving or afforesting one area leads to increased deforestation elsewhere

--

These (especially leakage) are challenges that arise with most environmental policies

---

# Challenges with offsets: additionality

Suppose we have a farmer growing corn

--

This farmer can convert $a$ acres of land to forest at some cost $PC(a)$

--

To keep things simple, 1 acre of land contains 1 unit of carbon

--

The private benefits of planting trees is $PB(a)$ (e.g. the farmer likes trees, trees help with soil degradation and retain moisture, other stuff)

--

The avoided carbon externalities is $EB(a)$ for total social benefits $SB(a) = PB(a) + EB(a)$

--

The farmer's optimal decision is given by the usual $PMB(a) = PMC(a)$

If $A^o < A^*$ the new PMB function will look something like this

The farmer gets the additional payment for the $A^0$ acres, but the offset did not change the value of the .hi[marginal acre]

The offset payments did not actually increase forest planting at all: was not .hi[additional]

.hi[Problem:] we paid the farmer for $A^p$ acres they would have planted anyway and got zero .hi[additional] forest for it

# Challenges with offsets: additionality

What are the takeaways?

--

Some carbon reduction efforts .hi[would have happened anyway]

--

We either got $0$ or we got $A^o - A^p$ units, not the planned $A^o$ additional units of carbon reduction

--

The money spent on the offsets could have potentially been spent elsewhere to get truly additional carbon reductions

--

Incentives need to matter .hi[on the margin] to affect behavior


---

# Challenges with offsets: leakage

Suppose we have no problems with additionality: we pay the farmer for $A^o$ acres, and the farmer plants $A^o$ additional acres

Are we guaranteed to now have $A^o$ units of total carbon reductions?

--

It turns out the answer to this is .hi[no]

--

Why?

---

# Challenges with offsets: leakage

A simple .hi[new] example to get the intuition

--

Suppose there are two cotton farmers, Ann and Bob

--

Ann and Bob both have $\bar{A}$ units of forested land, one unit of land can produce one unit of cotton

--

The cost of converting land to cotton production both Ann and Bob is $C(a)$

--

Ann and Bob face identical demand for cotton: $D(a)$

--

The price $p$ clears the cotton market

After the offsets, Ann can supply fewer consumers

People who were willing to pay more than $P^p$ but less than $P^o_a$ are no longer Ann's customers

.hi[But,] they can still buy from Bob!

People who were willing to pay less than $P^o$ increase Bob's residual demand

This shifts out Bob's demand at prices less than $P^o_a$

Bob's price rises to $P^o_b$

Bob then puts $A^o_b - A^p_b$ extra units of land into cotton production

$A^o_b - A^p_b$ units of carbon "leaked" from Ann to Bob

# Challenges with offsets: leakage

What are the takeaways?

--

If we pay people to not use something that has economic value, the price of its output will rise on global markets

--

This incentivizes extra production by others: the carbon we are trying to offset .hi[leaks] to other locations

--

How bad is leakage?

--

Depends on elasticities of supply and demand


---

# Challenges with offsets: leakage


Leakage is usually expressed as a percent of the original carbon reductions

--

In what situations (elasticities) is leakage worse or better?

--

Suppose supply for Ann and Bob was .hi[perfectly inelastic], how much leakage is there?

--

.hi[0%], why?

--

If Bob's supply is perfectly inelastic, his quantity of cotton does not adjust to the increase in price $\rightarrow$ no additional deforestation

--

Same deal if demand is perfectly inelastic


---

# Challenges with offsets: leakage


Suppose supply for Ann and Bob was .hi[perfectly elastic], how much leakage is there?

--

.hi[0%], why?

--

Prices don't change

--

But if supply is perfectly elastic then the offsets can't really be additional

--

Same deal if demand is perfectly elastic



---

# Challenges with offsets: leakage

Leakage matters when supply and demand are elastic, but not perfectly elastic
