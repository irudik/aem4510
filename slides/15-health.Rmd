# Roadmap

- How do we estimate the effect of a policy or environmental change when the treated and control groups do not (counterfactually) look the same in the cross-section?
- What is the mortality cost of lead?

# Our comparisons so far

So far we've made two kinds of comparisons to estimate treatment effects:

1. Comparing two groups with random assignment to treatment .hi[(RCT)]
--

2. Comparing two groups where there is a local discontinuity (i.e. discrete change) in policy .hi[(regression discontinuity)]

--

In both of these we are comparing groups in the .hi-blue[cross-section]: there is no concept of time, before and after a policy was enacted, etc

---

# Our comparisons so far

The key assumption for these comparisons is that 
--
the treated group would have looked the same as the control group (i.e. had the same outcomes) in the absence of treatment

--

This assumption is often hard to defend<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
One way people show that this tends to not be true is to throw in a bunch of extra controls into the regression, if this affects your estimates it indicates there's likely a problem with the assumption.
]

--

Let's try to relax this assumption by exploiting .hi-blue[temporal comparisons] in addition to the cross-sectional comparison

---

# Difference-in-differences

One way to describe our comparisons thus far is as .hi-red[differences]

--

The estimated effect of a policy is simply the difference in expected outcomes between treated and control groups:
$$\delta = E[Y^1|D=1] - E[Y^0|D=0]$$

--

It's exactly that for an RCT since $D$ was randomly assigned, and its the difference in conditional expectations (conditional on being around the threshold) for RDD

---

# Difference-in-differences

Our next method is called .hi-blue[difference-in-differences] (DD)

--

What DD does is take the difference of two comparisons in three steps:
--

1. Take the difference in mean outcomes between treated and control .hi-red[before] treatment
--

2. Take the difference in mean outcomes between treated and control .hi-red[after] treatment
--

3. Take the difference between 1 and 2

--

The name comes from the fact that we are taking the difference (3) between two differences (1 and 2)

---

# Difference-in-differences

Why do we use DD?

--

The identifying assumption required is less strict than for difference approaches

--

.hi[**DD assumption:**] the treatment and control group would have followed .hi-blue[parallel trends] in the absence of treatment
- i.e. the difference in outcomes would have remained constant

--

This is much less stringent than requiring the outcomes to have been the same in the absence of treatment

---

# Difference-in-differences

.hi-red[Example:] Suppose we want to understand the effect of a conservation policy passed in New York on biodiversity

--

Suppose also that:
- The effect of the New York policy is given by .hi[B]
--

- Each state has it's own fixed determinants of biodiversity (e.g. land cover, average temperature, etc) given by .hi[NY, PA, MA, etc]
--

- Each period has it's own determinants of biodiversity, common across all states (e.g. federal policy, global climate change) given by .hi[T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>], where 0 is years before the policy is passed, and 1 is after

---

# Difference-in-differences

When we observe data on biodiversity we see the combination of all determinants: .hi[B + NY + T], not just .hi[B]

--

We want to find a way to recover **only** .hi[E[B]]

--

There are two ways you could think about trying to estimate .hi[B] using differences:

--

1. Compare New York to another state after the policy is passed
--

2. Compare New York to itself, before and after the policy is passed

---

# The cross-sectional difference

Let's compare New York to another state, Pennsylvania

--

If we were to do this with differences we would get an estimate of .hi[B] given by: 
<center>
  .hi[(B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>) - (PA + T<sub>1</sub>) = B + NY - PA]
</center>

--

This is not .hi[B]!

--

Why?

---

# The cross-sectional difference

<center>
  .hi[(B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>) - (PA + T<sub>1</sub>) = B + NY - PA]
</center>

There are other determinants of biodiversity that are different across New York and Pennsylvania that are .hi-blue[not] the policy: landcover, urbanization, pollution, etc

--

If we take a simple difference across states, we can't disentangle whether the difference is due to the policy .hi[B] or differences in these other factors .hi[NY - PA]


---

# The time series difference

The next logical thing to try to circumvent this problem is to compare New York to itself, before .hi[NY + T<sub>0</sub>] and after .hi[B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>] the policy

--

<center>
  .hi[(B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>) - (NY + T<sub>0</sub>) = B + T<sub>1</sub> - T<sub>0</sub>]
</center>

--

This is not .hi[B]!

--

Why?


---

# The time series difference

<center>
  .hi[(B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>) - (NY + T<sub>0</sub>) = B + T<sub>1</sub> - T<sub>0</sub>]
</center>

There are other determinants of biodiversity that are different before and after the policy that are .hi-blue[not] the New York policy: federal policy changes, trends in urbanization and pollution

--

If we take a simple difference over time, we can't disentangle whether the difference is due to the policy .hi[B] or differences in other factors that are changing over time .hi[T<sub>1</sub> - T<sub>0</sub>]

---

# Difference-in-differences

With DD we .hi-blue[combine] these two differences

--

We take the time series differences for NY and PA:


|              |        After        |           Before           |                                Time Series Difference                               |
|:------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   New York   | B + NY + T<sub>1</sub> |   NY + T<sub>0</sub>   | (B + NY + T<sub>1</sub>) - (NY + T<sub>0</sub>) = .hi[B + T<sub>1</sub> - T<sub>0</sub>] |
| Pennsylvania |  PA + T<sub>1</sub> |     PA + T<sub>0</sub>     |  (PA + T<sub>1</sub>) - (PA + T<sub>0</sub>) = .hi[T<sub>1</sub> - T<sub>0</sub>]  |

--

Next,  difference the time series differences to get the DD<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup>You can also difference in the opposite order and end up with the same result
]

--

The time series differences lets us control for all fixed determinants within a state (.hi[NY])

--

The cross-sectional difference lets us control for all period-specific determinants common across all states (.hi[T<sub>1</sub>])

--

Combining these two differences addresses both and lets us recover .hi[B], the true effect of the policy!

---

# Difference-in-differences

Note that DD is not magic

--

It only can address determinants of biodiversity that are either:

--

1. Time-invariant
--

2. Time-varying, but common across all states

--

If there is a determinant of biodiversity that is varying over time, and differentially across states, DD will fail to correctly estimate .hi[B]
- State climate trends, state pollution trends, etc

---

# Difference-in-differences

Suppose that there is another determinant of biodiversity .hi[C<sup>NY</sup><sub>1</sub>, C<sup>NY</sup><sub>0</sub>] that only occurs in New York and varies over time
- e.g. climate in New York relative to Pennsylvania

Our DD is then

DD cannot isolate the effect of .hi[B] versus .hi[C<sup>NY</sup><sub>1</sub>- C<sup>NY</sup><sub>0</sub>]

There cannot be any (uncontrolled for) time varying differences between NY and PA if we want to correctly estimate .hi[B]

---

# Difference-in-differences: to the data

Now lets see how this works in practice: [notebook here](https://raw.githack.com/irudik/aem6510/master/lecture-notes/13-health-dd/13-health-dd-notebook.html)

--

What we are going to do is create a fake dataset where we .hi-blue[know the true value of what we want to estimate]

--

This is a good skill to practice to make sure you understand methods and that your code works correctly

# The effect of leaded gasoline on elderly mortality: Evidence from regulatory exemptions

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

---

# What is the paper about?

What is Hollingsworth and Rudik (2021) (.blue[HR]) about?

--

HR aims to estimate the .hi-red[causal] effect of lead on mortality

--

Why is this important? We know lead is bad

--

1. There is little causal evidence for any effects of lead
--

2. Almost zero *causal* evidence for effects of lead on adults in any way
--

3. Having an accurate measure of effects/costs is vital for policymaking

---

# Environmental research directly affects policy!

![federal_register](files/15-federal_register.png)

---

# How does the paper do it?

HR estimates the causal effect of lead by exploiting a .hi-blue[quasi-experiment]

--

A quasi-experiment is a real world occurrence that approximates an actual randomized control trial; quasi-experiments are also called natural experiments

---

# How does the paper do it?

Randomly assigning lead exposure to different groups is unethical, but we can learn from situations where real world exposure was *as good as random*

--

The quasi-experiment HR exploits is the sudden removal of lead from racing gasoline in 2007

--

Places that happened to have racetracks in 2007 had a significant decrease in lead emissions relative to places without racetracks

# Event studies

What HR do is actually a generalization of DD: an .hi-blue[event study]

--

An event study is basically just a DD with multiple time periods before and after the treatment

--

Here we estimate the effect of being in the treated group, relative to some baseline period
- In the 2x2 DD this baseline period was "before"

--

1. We can look at dynamic effects
--

2. It provides supporting evidence for the parallel trends assumption

---

# Event studies: dynamic effects

With an event study we can see how the effect of a policy changes *over time*

--

We will be able to estimate the effect in each post-period relative to some period

--

If we see estimates getting larger, the effect grows over time

--

If estimates get smaller, the effect shrinks


---

# Event studies: parallel pre-trends

In an event study we may have multiple periods before treatment

--

We can estimate the effect of being in the treatment group in each of these (pre-)periods

--

If there is no trend in the effect, the .hi-blue[pre-]trends are parallel

--

This gives us some comfort that the trends were likely to be parallel in the post-period in the absence of treatment

--

We never observe what would have .hi-red[actually] happened though, parallel pre-trends is just supporting evidence that the parallel trends assumption holds

# HR (2021): to the data

# HR (2021): takeaways

What can we take away from HR (2021)

1. Lead has a causal effect on elderly mortality
  - It appears to be through cardiovascular channels, perhaps *deaths of despair* as well (Case and Deaton, 2015)
2. The mortality costs are large
  - The external mortality costs imposed by NASCAR are larger than the value of all NASCAR teams combined
  - The social cost of lead is .hi-red[at least $1,000 per gram]
    - This is very, very, very big
