# The ideal world

In the best case scenario, a market equilibrium leads to the efficient allocation

--

Example: bread

--

We have a private bread supply curve (private MC)

--

We have a private bread demand curve (private MB)

--

In equilibrium: supply = demand so PMC = PMB = price

--

For bread, the private costs and benefits are very likely the social costs and benefits

# Externalities

If the world was just competitive markets, private goods, no third-parties, there would be no reason to do anything after Econ 101

--

That's not the case in the real world

--

In the real world we have .hi-blue[externalities]

> An externality exists whenever an individual or firm undertakes an action that impacts another individual or firm in an unintended way for which the latter is not compensated (a negative externality), or for which the latter does not pay (a positive externality)

---

# Externalities

What is problem with externalities for market outcomes and efficiency?

--

There is not a market for the externality

--

E.g. at Wegmans or Agway you will not find on sale:
- Cleaner air outside
- Biodiversity in the Amazon

--

The central problem is that there are goods that are .hi-red[not priced]

--

Markets rely on prices to reflect value


---

# Externalities: several classifications

We can classify externalities in a few ways:

.hi[Production externalities:] generated by a firm in the process of producing some output (e.g. pollution, innovation)

--

.hi[Consumption externalities:] generated by an individual in the process of consuming  an output (e.g. congestion, vaccination)

--

.hi-red[Negative externalities:] imposes external **costs** (e.g. pollution)

--

.hi-blue[Negative externalities:] imposes external **benefits** (e.g. vaccination)

# Why do externalities arise?

Typically one of two reasons:

1. Poorly defined property rights
  - Who owns the right to the air?
2. High transactions costs
  - Hard to bargain over desired air quality with millions of people


Lets conceptualize a model of efficient bargaining using an Edgeworth Box
  
---

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box  

- Two individuals: A and B
- Two private goods: X and Y

Each individual begins with an initial endowment of each good:
- $A: w_X^A, w_Y^A$
- $B: w_X^B, w_Y^B$

This gives us a total endowment:
- $W_X = w_X^A + w_X^B$
- $W_Y = w_Y^A + w_Y^B$

Initial indifference curves for A and B are $UA(0)$ and $UB(0)$

Yes!

If we move anywhere in the lens of their initial indifference curves we have a Pareto improvement

If we move to an allocation where their indifference curves are .hi[tangent] to one another (e.g. the filled-in point), we have a Pareto optimum

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box

In a properly functioning market:

- The endowment point is well-established
- A and B can trade X and Y to some Pareto improving point
- They continue trading until they achieve a Pareto optimal allocaiton
- This allocation lies on the .hi[contract curve]: the line consisting of all Pareto efficient allocations

Now suppose Y is not a private good, but a public good/bad, e.g. smoke

--

This means that A and B consume the .hi[exact same level of Y]

--

Unlike our regular Edgeworth Box, now Y increases for .hi[both] A and B as we move to the top of the slide (before Y increased for B as we moved to the bottom)

--

Suppose that A likes Y, but B does not

--

Suppose both start off with the same quantity of X

Depending on who has property rights, we either start at:

- W1 (B has property rights)
- W2 (A has property rights)

Think about why these are where we must start

Suppose we start at W1, what happens?

A wants to have more Y, but this imposes a cost on B

Therefore, A has to .hi[pay] B to get more Y

A pays B in units of X, move to Z1, Pareto optimum

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box

In the previous example we were able to achieve the Pareto optimum even with a public good / externality

--

Why?

--

1. Property rights were assigned to either A or B
--

2. Transactions costs were low (didn't have to pay a fee to trade X)

---

# Property rights and externalities

A solution to many externalities is to just assign property rights and let the market do its thing

--

We'll talk about a few ways that we can assign property rights

---

# Transactions costs and externalities

Now suppose there were many non-smokers

--

Even if they were assigned the property rights, it might be hard for them to bargain
  - Takes a lot of time to find something that works for everyone
  - Negotiating over how much X each person gets

--

The costs of bargaining may exceed the benefits and we end up stuck at W2

---

# Transactions costs and externalities

Road noise: drivers implicitly have property rights to noise around roads

--

Even if you prefer quiet, you can't negotiate a payment with every loud car that might pass pay

---

# The free-rider problem

Externalities and public goods/bads often exhibit many of the same features

Both are subject to the .hi[Free-Rider Problem]

> A type of market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods (such as public roads or hospitals), or services of a communal nature do not pay for them[1] or under-pay

e.g.

- people don't pay their taxes for publicly-provided services
- non-smokers will wait for others to pay in order to reduce smoke
