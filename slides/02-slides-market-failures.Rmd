# The ideal world

In the best case scenario, a market equilibrium leads to the efficient allocation

--

Example: bread

--

We have a private bread supply curve (private MC)

--

We have a private bread demand curve (private MB)

--

In equilibrium: supply = demand so PMC = PMB = price

--

For bread, the private costs and benefits are very likely the social costs and benefits

# Externalities

If the world was just competitive markets, private goods, no third-parties, there would be no reason to do anything after Econ 101

--

That's not the case in the real world

--

In the real world we have .hi-blue[externalities]

> An externality exists whenever an individual or firm undertakes an action that impacts another individual or firm in an unintended way for which the latter is not compensated (a negative externality), or for which the latter does not pay (a positive externality)

---

# Externalities

What is problem with externalities for market outcomes and efficiency?

--

There is not a market for the externality

--

E.g. at Wegmans or Agway you will not find on sale:
- Cleaner air outside
- Biodiversity in the Amazon

--

The central problem is that there are goods that are .hi-red[not priced]

--

Markets rely on prices to reflect value


---

# Externalities: several classifications

We can classify externalities in a few ways:

.hi[Production externalities:] generated by a firm in the process of producing some output (e.g. pollution, innovation)

--

.hi[Consumption externalities:] generated by an individual in the process of consuming  an output (e.g. congestion, vaccination)

--

.hi-red[Negative externalities:] imposes external **costs** (e.g. pollution)

--

.hi-blue[Negative externalities:] imposes external **benefits** (e.g. vaccination)

# Why do externalities arise?

Typically one of two reasons:

1. Poorly defined property rights
  - Who owns the right to the air?
2. High transactions costs
  - Hard to bargain over desired air quality with millions of people


Lets conceptualize a model of efficient bargaining using an Edgeworth Box

---

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box

- Two individuals: A and B
- Two private goods: X and Y

Each individual begins with an initial endowment of each good:
- $A: w_X^A, w_Y^A$
- $B: w_X^B, w_Y^B$

This gives us a total endowment:
- $W_X = w_X^A + w_X^B$
- $W_Y = w_Y^A + w_Y^B$

Yes!

If we move anywhere in the lens of their initial indifference curves we have a Pareto improvement

If we move to an allocation where their indifference curves are .hi[tangent] to one another (e.g. the filled-in point), we have a Pareto optimum

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box

In a properly functioning market:

- The endowment point is well-established
- A and B can trade X and Y to some Pareto improving point
- They continue trading until they achieve a Pareto optimal allocaiton
- This allocation lies on the .hi[contract curve]: the line consisting of all Pareto efficient allocations

Now suppose Y is not a private good, but a public good/bad, e.g. smoke

This means that A and B consume the .hi[exact same level of Y]

Unlike our regular Edgeworth Box, now Y increases for .hi[both] A and B as we move to the top of the slide (before Y increased for B as we moved to the bottom)

Suppose that A likes Y, but B does not

# Why do externalities arise? Edgeworth Box

In the previous example we were able to achieve the Pareto optimum even with a public good / externality

--

Why?

--

1. Property rights were assigned to either A or B
--

2. Transactions costs were low (didn't have to pay a fee to trade X)

---

# Property rights and externalities

A solution to many externalities is to just assign property rights and let the market do its thing

--

We'll talk about a few ways that we can assign property rights

---

# Transactions costs and externalities

Now suppose there were many non-smokers

--

Even if they were assigned the property rights, it might be hard for them to bargain
  - Takes a lot of time to find something that works for everyone
  - Negotiating over how much X each person gets

--

The costs of bargaining may exceed the benefits and we end up stuck at W2

---

# Transactions costs and externalities

Road noise: drivers implicitly have property rights to noise around roads

--

Even if you prefer quiet, you can't negotiate a payment with every loud car that might pass pay

---

# The free-rider problem

Externalities and public goods/bads often exhibit many of the same features

Both are subject to the .hi[Free-Rider Problem]

> A type of market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods (such as public roads or hospitals), or services of a communal nature do not pay for them[1] or under-pay

e.g.

- people don't pay their taxes for publicly-provided services
- non-smokers will wait for others to pay in order to reduce smoke

# The provision of public goods

# Public goods

How do we efficiently provide public goods?

We know:

- Private goods: PMB = PMC $\leftrightarrow$ SMB = SMC
- Goods with negative externalities: PMB = SMC $\leftrightarrow$ SMB = SMC
- goods with positive externalities: SMB = PMC $\leftrightarrow$ SMB = SMC

--

Suppose we have a public good, e.g. depth of a river for public use

How do we decide the socially efficient depth?


---

# Public goods

Optimal provision is .hi-blue[always] given by: SMB = SMC

What are the SMB and SMC for a public good?

--

Think about the characteristics of a public good, one of them is critical:

--

.hi[Non-rival:] multiple people can use the same unit of a good (one person using the river doesn't 'use up' its depth)

--

This means multiple people can derive benefits from the provision of 1 unit of the good

---

# Optimal provision of public goods

What does this mean?

--

When we count up the SMB, we need to add up .hi-blue[everyone's] PMB:

.hi[Optimality:] $SMB = \sum_i PMB_i =  PMC$

--

If we ignore the fact that public goods are non-rival, we get underprovision of the good

--

e.g. the free market underprovides clean air, national defense, etc

---

# Modeling the provision of public goods

How do we model public goods?

--

First: how do we aggregate marginal benefit or demand curves?

Here's how to think about it:

--

.hi-blue[For private goods:]

--

Private goods are rival, only one person can consume each unit

--

At each price, what is the total quantity that is demanded?

--

At each price, we need to add up quantities

--

Private goods: we add demand curves horizontally

---

# Modeling the provision of public goods


.hi-blue[For public goods:]

--

Public goods are non-rival, multiple people can consume each unit

--

At each quantity, what is the total marginal benefit?

--

At each quantity, we need to add up PMBs/prices

--

Public goods: we add demand curves vertically

The optimal provision of the public good is where the MC curve crosses the SMB curve

The optimal quantity of 22/3 is greater than the quantity any individual group would be willing to purchase

]


---

# Public goods financing

The socially optimal quantity is greater than the individual privately optimal quantities


--

This means that the MC of provision, MC = 22/3

--

Is this the price the groups pay?

--

.hi[No!] It is greater than any individual group is willing to pay

--

If the government is able to provide the good, how does it finance the cost raising the river depth above zero?

---

# Public goods financing

It charges each group a share of this price

--

What share is everyone charged?

--

.hi[Lindahl pricing:] charge each group equal to their marginal benefit

--

Boaters pay: 14/3  
Anglers pay: 8/3
Hikers: free

--

Notice that the prices sum to the marginal cost!

--

Since the good is non-rival, this is enough to finance the cost

---

# Public goods financing

What is a key problem with Lindahl pricing?

--

People can lie about which group they're in

--

Anglers might say they're hikers
